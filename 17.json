    "description" : "Across the 10,000 Weirdos in our collection, no two are the same - much like humankind itself. Consider every Weirdo minted representative of that holderâ€™s inner Weirdo, a cosmic embodiment of our one-of-a-kind oddities. Each composed of an assortment of natural materials from planet Earth, the Weirdos are designed to resemble the eco-fabric of our home. Importantly, each Weirdo holder will have the opportunity to use their voice to create actionable change on this planet. More than just an online community - Weirdos have the chance to help bolster our community and improve our world, leaving our home better than we found it.",
